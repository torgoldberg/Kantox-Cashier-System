### Cashier System

Simple cashier function that adds products to a cart and displays the total price. The following products are registered:

| Product Code | Name         | Price  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| GR1          | Green Tea    | Â£3.11  |
| SR1          | Strawberries | Â£5.00  |
| CF1          | Coffee       | Â£11.23 |

**Special Rules**

- Buy one get one free
- Buy > N products, pay X price per product
- Buy > N products, pay X% of the original price

**Products and Discount Rules**
The project doesn't connect to a database, it reads both the products and rules from a YAML file.
The default location of the file is priv/assets/products.yml and priv/assets/rules.yml, this can be changed in the Configuration.
Currently there are only 3 types of configurable discount rules:

- FreeRule (buy N get N free)
- ReducedPriceRule (buy more than N pay a different price)
- FractionPriceRule (buy more than N, pay a percentage of the original price)
